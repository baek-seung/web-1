	<p>Jesus Christ is God incarnate, the second person of the Trinity, our creator, the resurrected savior and redeemer, and the only means of salvation for sinners.</p>
	<p>Jesus of Nazareth was a Jewish carpenter and teacher in the first century A.D.<br> Jesus is the Christ or Messiah (Anointed One) of Israel.<br> He was born as God in the flesh, lived among men, and taught a “new covenant” in the Jewish tradition.<br> He was crucified by Roman authorities around A.D 30.<br> After he died, Jesus was buried and rose on the third day to prove his power over death.<br> His life, ministry, miracles, death, and resurrection point to his mission: Jesus Christ is both God and the Savior of the world.</p>
