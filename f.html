	<h1>Who Is Father God?</h1>
	<p>The past three or four decades have given rise to a new and now popular expression used by many Christians when they begin a public prayer.<br>
	The title of which we are concerned is whereby Christians address God in Heaven, which is our <strong>"Heavenly Father"</strong> with a 2-word term, phrase, or expression called - "<u>Father God</u>".<br>Pulpit preaching, bible teaching, public and private prayers, articles, and teaching materials in the Christian community are now peppered with this phrase - "Father God"</p>
